# PneumonioDetection_CNN
A deep learning CAD model, using CNNs, was developed for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. The AI system analyzes visual features for classification, aiming to improve early detection and reduce diagnostic variability. An easy-to-use web interface provides predictions, highlighting AI's role in clinical decision support.
